These are the lame-ass libs I build shit on.

Basically, to use any of these (from VS ofc), add all of the "include" and "lib" dir's from each C++ lib (and optionally their "src" dir's as well) to your global settings and go fucking nuts. For the C# shait, all output will go to each libs' "out/debug" and "out/release" dirs, and should also be copied to your GAC on build, so you shouldn't have to do anything more to set those up. If you have any problems, I don't give a shit. (Nah, but really, get in touch).
