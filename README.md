These are the lame-ass libs I build shit on.

Basically, to use any of these (from VS ofc), add all of the "include" and "lib" dir's from each C++ lib (and optionally their "src" dir's as well) to your global settings and go fucking nuts. For the C# shait, it's probably best to clone this repo (possibly as a submodule) in your project dir, and reference the project(s) you need directly. If you have any problems, I don't give a shit. (Nah, but really, get in touch).

Also, Fbl uses some code from this repo: https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-c-driver which is licensed under the Apache License version 2.0. A copy of that license is in a file called LICENSE under Fbl/src/mongo-c-driver/.
