These are the lame-ass libs I build shit on.

Basically, to use any of these (from VS ofc), add all of the "include" and "lib" dir's from each C++ lib (and optionally their "src" dir's as well) to your global settings and go fucking nuts. For the C# shait, all output will go to your GAC on build (meaning you need to run VS as admin), so you shouldn't have to do anything more to set those up. If you have any problems, I don't give a shit. (Nah, but really, get in touch).
